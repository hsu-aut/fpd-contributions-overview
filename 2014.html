                    <h3><b>Integrating plant and process information as a basis for automated plant diagnosis tasks</b>
                    </h3>
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
                    <p>Effective use of integrated process and plant knowledge may significantly increase the accuracy
                        and reliability of automated plant diagnostics. State-of-the-art diagnosis methods, however, do
                        not exploit the whole richness of information found in process facilities mainly due to the
                        difficulties entailed for its collection and timely retrieval. In an effort to contribute
                        towards the exploitation of such knowledge, this paper presents concepts to classify, integrate,
                        and facilitate the access to relevant data as a basis for automated plant diagnosis tasks. The
                        proposed integration is based on the Formalized Process Description Guideline VDI/VDE 3682 and
                        comprises four fundamental information sources, namely plant connectivity, plant dimension
                        specific-, plant component specific-, and process specific-knowledge. The resulting model is
                        described in the data format CAEX/AutomationML, which allows for seamless and effective
                        information exchange among different diagnostic tools. Further concepts for data access and
                        visualization are presented in this contribution.</p>
