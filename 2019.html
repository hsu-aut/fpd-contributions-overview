                    <h3><b>An Interface-Oriented Resource Capability Model to Support Reconfiguration of Manufacturing
                            Systems</b></h3>
                    <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
                    <p>Global trends in manufacturing force companies to deal with a production environment with
                        increasing dynamics. In such an environment, companies have to cope with frequent changes of
                        production requirements and conditions. In order to cope with these frequent changes,
                        manufacturing machines have been designed to be reconfigurable. Although machines of this type
                        have the potential to deal with a dynamic production environment, their full potential cannot be
                        exploited, yet. One crucial reason for this is the long reaction time for the identification and
                        design of a required system configuration. A first step towards problem solving is to have a
                        capability model of manufacturing resources. Based on such a capability model, the
                        manufacturability of production requests could be quickly analyzed. In addition, these models
                        can be utilized to generate new configurations, which match changed requirements. However, state
                        of the art approaches have several drawbacks regarding the efficient analysis of
                        manufacturability and feasible resource reconfigurations. Accordingly, this contribution
                        presents an interface-oriented approach for the modeling of manufacturing resource capabilities.
                        The approach aims at the facilitation of the manufacturability check and reconfiguration
                        analysis. Furthermore, the implementation of the modeling concept in AutomationML is presented,
                        which allows a machine-interpretable representation of the model in a neutral data format. The
                        applicability of the approach is illustrated by an example of an automated riveting system at
                        Airbus and a discussion regarding the advantages and drawbacks of the developed approach is
                        given.

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
                    <p>The increase of product variants and their frequent change result in new challenges for
                        manufacturing companies. Companies have to find a way to efficiently manage the production of
                        all variants by having rapidly adaptable manufacturing resources. However, in order to utilize
                        the full potential of these types of resources, a machine interpretable capability model is
                        required. Such a model can facilitate the production planning and reconfiguration process, as
                        production requests can be quickly analyzed by the usage of the model. In addition, the model
                        can be utilized to generate new configurations, which match the changing requirements.
                        Accordingly, this contribution presents an approach for the modeling of manufacturing resource
                        capabilities. The approach aims at providing an efficient basis for the matching of production
                        requests and resource capabilities. Furthermore, the capability model should enable a change
                        analyses for the adaptation of the resources, in order to quickly adjust them to the changing
                        requirements. The proposed capability model has been implemented in AutomationML and XML, which
                        allows a machine-interpretable representation of the model in a neutral data format. The
                        applicability of the approach is demonstrated by a case study of an industrial high-voltage
                        testing machine.

                    <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
                    <p>In discrete manufacturing, basic and detail engineering workgroups need to collaborate to design highly automated cyber-physical production systems. Product/ion-awareness describes views and requirements coming from product and production process design, which are relevant to engineer production resources. These requirements imply strong dependencies between the product, the production process, and production resources (PPR). The Formal Process Description (FPD) provides basic concepts for modeling PPR knowledge, which support discrete manufacturing to some extent. In this paper, we introduce a meta-model that describes the structure of the FPD including a set of proposed extensions, focusing on expressing consistency dependencies on PPR relations, as a foundation for making design decisions traceable in the engineering process. In addition, the meta-model provides a clear description of how to model parallel or alternative process flows, a common use case in discrete manufacturing. The meta-model provides stakeholders with a clear description of the PPR modeling language (PPR-ML) and a rule set to check the validity of a model.
